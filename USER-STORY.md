Website Concept

A quiz website, where users can log on and catch up on the news of the week by completing the quiz. 

The database will be seeded with 110 questions each week and the user will visit the same URL and the question will be updated. 

The user will see all 10 questions and next to each question there will be a clickable button that says 'show answer'. When the user wants to see the answer for a particular question they will click 'show answer' and the answer will appear. 

The users score out of 10 will display at the top of the page. 

Next to each question there will be clickable tick box under the heading 'Correct'. If the user gets the answer correct they will click the tick box and their score out of 10 will add 1.
